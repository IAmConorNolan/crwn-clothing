### NOTE: Cloning this project.

If you choose to fork and clone this repo, it will not currently run correctly. A file called .env must be added to the root folder! In that .env file remember to add a STRIPE_SECRET_KEY value equal to your own secret key from your stripe dashboard. You can find it in the same place where you found your publishable key in the developers tab under api keys. You will have to enter the password in to reveal it!
